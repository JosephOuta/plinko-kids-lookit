                "text": "The goal of this study is to understand whether or not children are sensitive to perceptual differences that may make counting easier or harder. As you may recall, this study started off by asking your child to determine which book is easier to count and then which tower is easier to build. These were warm up trials. Then, your child was asked to discriminate between # sets of dotted cards. These dots varied in three basic ways: size, color, and spatial arrangement. These were our main trials of interest.\n\nWhy is this important? \n\nIf young children can generate consistent intuitions about the perceptual difficulty of this counting task, this suggests that they may be sensitive to factors that affect perceptual discrimination. \n\nThank you so much for participating! You will receive an email from Lookit with your payment information. Please don’t hesitate to contact me at perezke@mit.edu if you have any additional questions or feedback.",
